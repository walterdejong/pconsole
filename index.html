This is the pconsole distribution page. pconsole is a administrative tool for
working with clusters of machines.<br>
pconsole allows you to connect to each node of your cluster simultaneously,
and you can type your administrative commands in a specialized window that
'multiplies' the input to each to the connections you have opened.<br>
pconsole is best run from within X Windows, although it is possible to
employ it without X (in console mode) as well.<br>
You need to install pconsole on only 1 machine in the cluster, this would
usually be your central administrative node.<br>
pconsole was developed by Walter de Jong in 2001.
